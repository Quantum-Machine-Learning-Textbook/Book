    "Bits are the basic unit of information in classical computation, often represented by 0 and 1. Physically implemented using electronic circuits like Flip-Flops, a bit can be present in either 0 or 1 at a given time. Any information can be encoded using this basic unit. To get better precision, we can simply use more number of bits, thereby taking up more memory."
